    <p>Copy the code from the working examples:</p>
      <p><a class="btn btn-default btn-lg" href="https://github.com/gc-proto/experimental/blob/master/departmental-plans-ministeriels/dp-at-glance.md" role="button">At  a glance page code</a></p>

    <!--<p>Publishing and submitting  the content:</p>
      <p>The Word documents are to be saved as  PDFs and used for approvals and submitting to TBS.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Review the Word documents for accessibility so they can be converted  properly to PDF for submitting to TBS and tabling in Parliament. </li>
      <li>To create the PDF: Save each page as a PDF, consolidate into a  single document and add a cover page with the required copyright information,  minister signature, ISSN, and Catalogue number.</li>
      <li>Be sure to follow up with your departmental colleagues responsible  for final content prior to finalizing the online version as TBS conducts a  quality check of the report and may request edits.</li>
      <li>Once content is confirmed as final, create the pages using the  working examples to ensure consistency across Canada.ca.</li>

  <section>
    <h2 id="toc05">Research and rationale</h2>
    <p>Research will be ongoing to determine the best way to present information contained in the DP in an accessible and user-friendly way. To date, some known issues include non-intuitive headers, repetitive information, and overly complex tables.</p>
    <p>Further improvements will be made incrementally as more research is completed on both the implementation and user experience sides. If you&rsquo;re interested in participating in usability testing, please <a href="mailto:DAS.SCN@tbs-sct.gc.ca">reach out to the TBS theme lead(s)</a>.</p>
