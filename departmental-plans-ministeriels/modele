## Content and design

The departmental plan template consists of 2 layouts:

*   Full plan page: provides a detailed breakdown of how the organization is spending and plans to spend on its core responsibilities

## How to implement



## Research and rationale

<h3>Research findings</h3>

Research is ongoing to determine the best way to present information contained in the departmental plans in an accessible and user-friendly way. To date, some known issues include non-intuitive headers, repetitive information and overly complex tables.

<h3>Policy rationale</h3>

Insitutions are required to publish departmental plans annually. This template supports a consistent approach to how departmental plans are presented on Canada.ca.



## Latest changes

2023-08-10: Created a two-page layout pattern to target different audiences for departmental plans, including simplified tables, revised wording for headers and reduced the overall length of the plan
