    <h2>Refocusing Government Spending </h2>
    <p>In  Budget 2023, the government committed to reducing spending by  $14.1&nbsp;billion over the next five&nbsp;years, starting in 2023–24, and by  $4.1&nbsp;billion annually after that.</p>
    <p>As part of meeting this commitment, [organization  name] is planning the following spending reductions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2024-25</strong>: $ [insert amount]</li>
      <li><strong>2025-26</strong>: $ [insert amount]</li>
      <li><strong>2026-27 and ongoing</strong>: [insert amount]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>[Organization  name] will achieve these  reductions by doing the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>[savings measure  1]</li>
      <li>[savings measure  2]</li>
      <li>[savings measure 3]</li>
      <li>[add bullets as  needed]</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The figures in this  departmental plan reflect these reductions. </p>
