Oral health providers enrolled in the CDCP will be required to submit the claims directly to Sun Life for payment rather than having patients seek reimbursement from Sun Life for services covered under the plan. The CDCP will pay part of the cost, and you’ll pay the rest. The amount that you pay is called a co-payment. Your co-payment is based on your adjusted family net income. The CDCP will only pay for oral health care services covered under the CDCP at the established CDCP fees."
