<h2>Content and design</h2>
<p>The institutional landing page is composed of several required and optional patterns.</p>
<h3>Required patterns on an institutional landing page</h3>
<ul class="mrgn-tp-lg">
  <li><a href="#">Introduction block</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the applied title of the institution (see <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/fip-pcim/reg-eng.asp">Registry of Applied Titles</a>).</li>
      <li>The description should be a very brief summary of what the institution does.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Most requested</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Features institution-specific top tasks.</li>
      <li>If any one of the institution's top tasks are already included as a direct link under Services and information, do not duplicate them here.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Services and information</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The services and information pattern points to the top-level categories of your organizationâ€™s information architecture.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Contact us band</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The first link should be the main contact for your institution. You should limit the band to three contact links.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">About the institution</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Ministers block</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional patterns on an institutional landing page</h3>
<ul class="mrgn-tp-lg">
  <li><a href="#">Social media pattern</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Super task button</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Only include a super task button if there is a specific task that has at least a third of the clickthrough on the institution's home page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Flexible space</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The bottom portion of the page above the footer is an optional content area. The default for this template is the latest news and context-specific features patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
