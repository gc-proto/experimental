## When to use

Use this template to create a central starting point for an institution's accessibility information and services.



## What to avoid

Don't create more than one institutional accessibility page per department or agency.


  
## Content and design

Find content and design specifications and visual examples.


### Content specifications

The institutional accessibility page consists of:

- a title
- an introduction
- a supertask button for accessibility feedback 
- links to corporate accessibility information

#### Title

The title should read "Accessibility at \[name of institution]" in English, and "Accessibilité à \[nom de l'institution]" in French.

#### Introduction

The introduction provides a brief explanation of the kind of feedback expected from users, such as input on the institution's accessibility plan or comments about accessibility barriers experienced with services.

#### Supertask button for accessibility feedback

- Since giving accessibility feedback is the top task for this page, provide a link to the feedback mechanism using a supertask button
- The label should read "Provide feedback" in English, and "Fournir une rétroaction" in French
- Find out how to use a super task button:

#### Links to corporate accessibility information

- Use services and information links (doormats) to give access to corporate accessibility information, such as accessibility plans or progress reports, or a description of the institution's process for responding to incoming feedback
- Find out how to use the services and information pattern:

## How to implement

Copy the code from the working examples:
- [English working example](https://test.canada.ca/accessibility/landing-example.html)
- [French working example](#)

## Research and rationale

<h3>Research findings</h3>

This template is experimental. Research is needed to determine the optional approach. 

<h3>Policy rationale</h3>

Under the Accessible Canada Act and Regulations, insitutions are required to publish the following on their websites:

- an accessibility plan every 3 years
- annual accessibility reports
- a description of the process for handing accessibility feedback
- a mechanism for receiving feedback

This template helps to tie all these things together in a central location for each institution.
