### Content specifications

The institutional accessibility page consists of:

- a title
- an introduction
- a supertask button for accessibility feedback 
- links to corporate accessibility information

#### Title

- The title should read "Accessibility at \[name of institution]" in English, and "Accessibilité à \[nom de l'institution] in French

#### Introduction

- The introduction provides a brief explanation of the kind of feedback expected from users, such as input on the institution's accessibility plan or comments about accessibility barriers experienced with services

#### Supertask button for accessibility feedback

- Since providing accessibility feedback is the top task for this page, provide a link to the feedback mechanism using a supertask button
- The label should read "Provide feedback" in English, and "Fournir une rétroaction" in French

## How to implement



## Research and rationale

<h3>Research findings</h3>

Research is ongoing to determine the best way to present information contained in the departmental plans in an accessible and user-friendly way. To date, some known issues include non-intuitive headers, repetitive information and overly complex tables.

<h3>Policy rationale</h3>

Insitutions are required to publish departmental plans annually. This template supports a consistent approach to how departmental plans are presented on Canada.ca.



## Latest changes

2023-08-10: Created a two-page layout pattern to target different audiences for departmental plans, including simplified tables, revised wording for headers and reduced the overall length of the plan
