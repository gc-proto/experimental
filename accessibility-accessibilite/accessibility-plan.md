## When to use

Use this template when publishing your institution's accessibility plan.



## What to avoid

Don't create more than one accessibility plan per department or agency.



## Content and design

Find content and design specifications and visual examples.


### Content specifications

Ensure the plan meets the requirements outlined in the ESDC guidance on accessibility plans. This guidance includes a content template for writing the plan.

*  [Guidance on accessibility plans](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada-regulations-guidance/accessibility-plans.html)
*  [Sample accessibility plan template](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-canada-regulations-guidance/accessibility-plans/template.html)

People are encouraged to provide feedback on accessibility plans - ensure there is a link to the feedback process and/or feedback form directly from the plan.

To ensure findability, there is an index of all institutional accessibility plans on the open government portal. Include a link to this index directly from the plan. 


### Design specifications

* Uses standard Canada.ca styles and patterns

## How to implement


### Working examples

Copy the code from the working examples:

* English working example 
* French working example


### Publishing requirements

Ensure your accessibility plan is included on the Open Government Portal: 

*  [Instructions for including accessibility plans on the open government portal](#)

According to the Mandatory procedures for publishing, institutional accessibility plans are considered publications. Request an ISSN and submit a copy to publications.gc.ca:

* [Instructions for adding accessibility plans to publications.gc.ca](#)

Institutions must notify the Accessibility Commissioner at the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) within 48 hours of publishing their accessibility plans: 

*  Send an email to Info.Com@chrc-ccdp.gc.ca or use the CHRCâ€™s [My Accessibility Portal](https://www.accessibilitychrc.ca/en/notify-accessibility-commissioner) service



## Research and rationale


### Research findings

This template is experimental. Research is needed to determine the optimal approach.


### Policy rationale

Under the Accessible Canada Act and Regulations, insitutions are required to publish an accessibility plan every 3 years. This template ensures consistency for the accessibility plan from each institution.
