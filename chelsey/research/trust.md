In recent years, Canada has seen an unprecedented number of fraud cases[^1]. Many of these cases use technology to target their victims. This makes it more important than ever to ensure that users can recognize official Government of Canada (GC) websites. 

Consistency in design is a crucial element to help foster trust among users. Previous research done during our Wayfinding project suggested that consistent design elements across Government of Canada sites increase trust. 

The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) conducted a Trust study to better understand which Government of Canada design elements are more strongly associated with trust and confidence in the brand. The study measured and compared respondents’ trust in the following:

-  Federal Identity Program (FIP) flag symbol
-  Canada.ca domain
-  Theme menu button 
-  Sign-in button  

The findings demonstrated that the FIP was essential to the brand and must appear in colour (red). The Canada.ca domain, as well as a consistent Sign in pattern were also identified as being important to user trust.  In contrast, the theme menu button was not an essential design element for gaining user trust.

## Method
We conducted an interactive trust exercise from June 9 to 22, 2022. The exercise had 2,726 respondents, recruited via an invitation on Canada.ca. There were 4 versions of the study across both official languages and a mobile vs computer layout. 48% of participants answered from within Canada. 78% responded in English, and 73% completed all the questions.

For each question, people were shown 2 images with slight variations of brand elements. They were asked to identify which image they found more trustworthy. If their level of trust was the same for both images, they could respond with “same”.
