<p>This is a mockup of the future state of the Breadcrumb trail pattern.</p>
<p>The breadcrumb trail is a horizontal series of links that gives people a sense of where they are in relation to Canada.caâ€™s navigation model.  It represents the location of a page in relation to its parent and provides a clear way to navigate to higher levels in the site structure.</p>
