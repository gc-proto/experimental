<p>Small changes make a big difference.</p>

<p>Sometimes the words we use, and how we organize them, can make it hard for people to find and understand Government of Canada information and services on Canada.ca. The TBS Digital Transformation Office is working on projects with federal departments to make it easier.</p>
<p>For each project, we co-create prototypes, set concrete usability targets, and run usability tests with Canadians. We ask questions Canadians have about specific Government of Canada services. For a prototype to launch, it must make it at least 20% easier for people to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Considering the high numbers of visits to in-demand pages, such an increase in task success rates is significant. Ultimately it means people spend less time looking for the answers they need from the Government of Canada.</p>
<h2>Projects with our partners</h2>
