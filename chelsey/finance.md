            <h2 id="a3">Impacts of unjustified U.S. trade actions</h2>
            <p>Canada and the United States have the world's most comprehensive and dynamic <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/us-eu/relations.aspx?lang=eng#a4">trading
                    relationship</a>, which supports millions of jobs in both countries. We are each other's largest
                trading partners with US$2.5 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day.</p>
            <p>Canadian countermeasures are about protecting and defending Canada's interests, consumers, workers, and
                businesses. </p>
            <h3>How this affects individuals</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>The U.S. tariffs will impact Canadians and Americans alike. They will increase costs for
                        consumers, put thousands of jobs at risk, and weaken North America's competitiveness in the
                        global economy. Tariffs will upend production at U.S. auto assembly plants and oil refineries,
                        and raise costs for American consumers—at gas pumps and grocery stores, whether for products
                        made in Canada or U.S.-made products that use Canadian materials, putting American prosperity at
                        risk.</p>
                    <p>Canada's countermeasure of applying tariffs on U.S. goods being imported into Canada raises the
                        prices of those goods for sale in Canada, making them less desirable for Canadian consumers to
                        purchase. By raising prices and reducing their demand by Canadian consumers, this sends a
                        message to U.S. businesses and the U.S. government on the need to reverse the imposition of
                        tariffs, for the benefit of both Canadians and Americans.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, to help reduce the financial burden on Canadian consumers as a result of higher
                        prices on American products, the Government of Canada encourages Canadian consumers to switch
                        from purchasing American products to those made in Canada. This will also help support Canadian
                        businesses by increasing their domestic sales, especially if their exports are impacted by U.S.
                        tariffs.</p>

                    <p>Canadian companies that rely on cross-border supply chains will face logistical and financial

                    <p>With many U.S. businesses relying on Canadian imports, tariffs on Canadian goods and materials
                        will raise prices considerably for American businesses and consumers, leading to inflationary
