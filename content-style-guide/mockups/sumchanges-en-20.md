  <p>You can use images and videos to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>enhance key messages</li>
    <li>help people complete their task </li>
    <li>make complicated information easier to understand</li>
    <li>reflect Canada's diverse population as much as possible (including seniors, youth, Indigenous peoples, and people from a wide variety of ethnic origins)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When planning your content, weigh the benefits of using videos with the impact on people who will try to view them using mobile devices. Data plans and reliable network access vary.</p>
  <h3>Obtain permission to publish</h3>
  <p>Make sure that you have the appropriate permissions to publish images, audio files and videos online. You'll need to have the written proof of those rights. Refer to the <cite><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27167">Procedures for Publishing</a></cite> or contact your institution's authoring team for more details.</p>

  <h3>6.1 Understand the purpose of images online</h3>
  <p>Images can distract people. They can also make the page take longer to load. Make sure your images <strong>add value</strong> to your content.</p>
  <p>There are 2 main types of images:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>functional images</li>
    <li>decorative images </li>
  </ul>
  <section id="wp6-1-1">
    <h4>Functional images</h4>
    <p>Functional images:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>illustrate information or data to help people understand it</li>
      <li>explain a complex concept </li>
      <li>illustrate concrete things (such as a valid passport, species at risk, standard symbols)</li>
      <li>convey branding (such as approved logos and campaign graphics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functional images add value to the content because they provide more information than can be provided through text alone. Examples of functional images:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>infographics</li>
      <li>illustration</li>
      <li>diagram</li>
      <li>image map</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="#wp6-2">Include the appropriate alternative text</a> to describe the image for people who are unable to view it.</p>
    <h5>Example of functional images</h5>

    <h4>Decorative images</h4>
    <p>Use decorative images only to provide visual context for the following templates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a theme or topic page</li>
      <li>the home page</li>
      <li>campaign pages</li>
      <li>promotional features on a topic page or home page (Government of Canada activities and initiatives)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don't place meaningful text, such as campaign or program titles, in decorative images.</p>
    <p>Get details about the templates above in the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/communications/cia-sca-eng.asp">Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification</a>.</p>
    <h5>Example of a decorative image</h5>
    <p><img alt="Decorative image in context to create visual interest" class="img-responsive" src="/style-guide/images/shopping-cart-02.png" /></p>
    <h5>Don’t describe decorative images</h5>
    <p>Decorative images don’t require a description. Their only purpose is to add visual appeal to content, not to add contextual information. The decorative image in our example just helps to create visual interest. Using a description for a decorative image gives users unnecessary information that can distract from the content on the page.</p>
    <h5>Alt text for decorative images</h5>
    <p>Use the null indicator as the alternative text (alt="") for decorative images. This tells screen readers to ignore the image.</p>

  <h3>6.2 Include alternative text for images</h3>
  <p>Alternative text (or alt text) is text that describes an image. It makes it possible for people using assistive technologies to access the information conveyed by an image. It also helps search engines better understand the purpose of the image.</p>
  <p>When you're writing alternative text for a <a href="#wp6-1-1">functional image</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describe the image as if you were describing it to someone over the phone</li>
    <li>use as few words as possible</li>
    <li>limit the text to around 140 characters (including spaces)</li>
    <li>use the text that is embedded in the image only if it provides enough context; otherwise, write different text that includes more information</li>
    <li>use the null indicator as the alternative text (alt="") if the image doesn't provide any more information than what is already provided in the text on the page</li>
    <li>don't use "image of..." or "graphic of..." to describe the image; screen readers do this already</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="#wp6-1-2">Decorative images</a> don't require additional information to make them accessible or visible to search engines. Use the null indicator as the alternative text (alt="").</p>

  <h3>6.3 Include long descriptions for complex images</h3>
  <p>Long descriptions explain information that is presented in complex infographics or images. You must provide a long description if you can't describe the content and function of the image in less than 140 characters. If you can describe the image in less than 140 characters, use alternative text instead.</p>
  <p>If a detailed and equivalent explanation of the image appears in the text immediately before or after a complex image, you don't have to provide a long description.</p>
  <p>If you provide a long description for an image, you must also provide alternative text for the long description.</p>
  <p>Figure 1 illustrates a number of concepts. It requires a long description.</p>
  <h4>Example: Long description for the balanced scorecard</h4>
  <figure class="mrgn-bttm-lg">
    <figcaption class="text-center"> <strong>Figure 1: using a balanced scorecard approach to monitor key performance indicators</strong> </figcaption>
    <img alt="A balanced scorecard showing how business activities align with an organization's vision and strategy to monitor key performance indicators. Text version below. " class="img-responsive center-block" src="/style-guide/images/fig-01b-eng.jpg" />
    <h5>Alternative text</h5>
    <p>You could write the following alternative text for the image shown in Figure 1:</p>
    <p>A balanced scorecard showing how business activities align with an organization's vision and strategy to monitor key performance indicators. Text version below.</p>
    <h5>Long description</h5>
    <p>You could write the following long description for the image shown in Figure 1:</p>
    <p>A balanced scorecard is a strategic planning and management system used worldwide to align business activities with an organization's vision and strategy.</p>
    <p>Business activities are grouped into 4 perspectives, all of which are interdependent and come from the vision and strategy. These are learning and growth, internal business processes, financial, and customer. Each has a question associated with it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning and growth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To achieve our vision, how will we sustain our ability to change and improve?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Internal business processes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To satisfy our shareholders and customers, what business processes must we excel at?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To succeed financially, how should we appear to our shareholders?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To achieve our vision, how should we appear to our customers?</p>
    <p>Each perspective can be monitored using the following 4 components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>objectives</li>
      <li>messages</li>
      <li>targets</li>
      <li>initiatives</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Figure 2 is a bar chart. The information in it came from a data table. You could therefore use the table as the long description for this image.</p>

  <h3>6.4 Include transcripts to describe audio and video files</h3>
  <p>A transcript is the text equivalent of an audio or video file. They make it easier for people who need to access information in audio or visual media but can't hear or see the content because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they have a disability</li>
    <li>don't have equipment such as speakers or headphones</li>
    <li>don't want to download a large file</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make sure the transcript describes all pre-recorded information and action, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>on-screen text</li>
    <li>dialogue and narration </li>
    <li>important sounds (such as an explosion)</li>
    <li>important action (for example, people running away from an explosion or characters wearing disguises)</li>
  </ul>
