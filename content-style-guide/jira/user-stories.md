<h2 class="h3">What is a user story?</h2>
<p>An agile user story is an informal, general explanation of a product feature or enhancement written from the perspective of the end user. It states how the feature or enhancement provides value to a person using the product.</p>
<p>A user story is the smallest unit of work.  It’s an end goal, a useable state, expressed from the perspective of the person who uses the product.  The purpose is to state in a simple way how a piece of work will deliver a particular value for the end user.</p>
<p>Our end users are not just external users of Canada.ca, they are also the content creators who produce those pages.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the user story does not provide solutions (that is the work of the team).  It simply states what is desired.</p>
<h2 class="h3">User story structure</h2>
<p class="h3 mrgn-bttm-lg">"<strong>As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].</strong>"</p>
<p><strong>As a:</strong> this is the WHO. Who are we building this for? Who is the user?</p>
<p><strong>I want</strong> this is the WHAT. What are we building? What is the intention?</p>
<p><strong>So that</strong> this is they WHY. Why are we building it? What is the value for the customer?</p>
<h2 class="h3">Examples</h2>
<p>"As a content writer for Canada.ca, I want to be able to access the style guide when I am off-line, so that I can consult the style guide when I am writing, but do not have access to the internet."</p>
<p>"As an HTML coder for Canada, I want to show my client why breaking down complex tables into simple tables makes pages more accessible, so that I will have documented “support” for creating better table presentation."</p>
<p>"As a transgender Canadian citizen, I want to read content on Canada.ca that is gender neutral, so that I feel considered and included."</p>
