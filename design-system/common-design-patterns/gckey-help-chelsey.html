            <p>Once you sign up to create a GCKey username and
                password, you can use it to sign in to any Government of Canada online account that supports GCKey.
            </p>
            <p><strong>You still have to register
                    for each account,</strong> so that it can match your GCKey username and password to your account
                profile.</p>
            <p>To sign up:</br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>first</strong> <a
                        href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/sign-in-online-account.html">find the account or
                        government service </a>you want to register for</li>
                <li>then use the <strong>GCKey button </strong>to register or sign-in, if GCKey is supported for that
                    account</li>
                <li>on the Welcome to GCKey page, click the <strong>Sign up </strong>button</li>
            </ul>
            Whenever you sign in to that account in the future, use the GCKey username and password to sign in.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Anyone in any country </strong>can use the GCKey service provided by the Government of Canada.

                <summary>Check if you need another GCKey username and password</summary>
                <p><strong>You usually only need one GCKey username and password</strong> to sign into any government
                    service that supports GCKey:</br>
                <ul>
                    <li>for example, sign up for a GCKey username and password to register and reserve a campsite in My
                        Parks
                        Canada Reservation Account</li>
                    <li>then use your same GCKey username and password to register and sign in to My Service Canada
                        Account
                        to manage your Employment Insurance or Canada Pension</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>You can have more than one GCKey username and password pair, for example for work vs
                    personal accounts. If you do sign up for another: </br>
                <ul>
                    <li>remember which username and password pair to use with each service</li>
                    <li>use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username and password pair</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>If your GCKey username and password have expired</strong> after not being used for 2 years,

<ul>
<li> make your username easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess</li>
<li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing address, or email address</li>
<li>keep your username secure and do not share it with anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>Each username must be unique. You will receive a message if the username you create has already been used.</p>
<h3>Create your password</h3>

<p>As you enter a password a red “x” or a green checkmark will appear in the <strong>Password Checklist</strong>. The “x” means you have not met the password requirements. The checkmark means you have met the password requirements.</p> 
<h4>Tips for creating a password</h4>

                <h3>Create recovery questions, answers and hints:</h3>
                <p> Recovery questions are used to help you if you forget your password.</p>
                <p>Your questions, answers and hints should be easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.
<h4>Recovery question</h4>
<p>Recovery questions and answers are mandatory. To create yours follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the first question, choose a recovery question from the <strong>Select a Recovery Question</strong> field.</li>
    <li>Enter an answer to the question in the <strong>My Recovery Answer</strong> field.</li>  
    <li>Next, enter the name of someone you will remember in the <strong>Memorable Person</strong> field.</li> 
<ul><li>If you think you may forget the answer to this question, you can enter a hint in the <strong>Memorable Person Hint</strong> field.</li></ul> 
    <li>Next, enter a date that you will remember in the <strong>My Memorable Date</strong> field.</li></ul></li> 
<ul><li>If you think you may forget the answer to this question, you can enter a hint in the <strong>Memorable Date Hint</strong> field.</li></ul>
                </ol>
                  
                <h3>Add your email address in case you forget username or password</h3>
    <p>On the <strong>Optional Account Recovery</strong> page you can add an email address. This email address will be used to help you recover your GCKey account if you forget your username or password.</p> 
<p>You do not have to add an email address, this step is optional.</p> 
<p>As you enter an email address a red “x” or a green checkmark will appear in the <strong>Email Checklist</strong>. The “x” means you have not met the email requirements. The checkmark means you have met the email requirements.</p> 
<h4>Confirmation code:</h4>
<p>The confirmation code is the code sent to the recovery email address associated with your GCKey account. It allows you to verify that the email address you entered is correct. Once you have confirmed your email address by entering the confirmation code, the email address can then be used to help you in case you forget your GCkey username or password.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your email address is associated with another GCKey account, a warning message will appear indicating that your email address is already in use. You will have the option to:</p>
<ol> 
<li>attempt to recover the username and/or password of the other GCKey account associated with that email address by following the process for username recovery or password reset</li>
<li>register a different email address</li> 
<li>register the email address to your new GCKey account by completing the email address registration process. If you choose to complete this process, the system will then remove the email address from your other GCKey account</li>

            <p>If you've forgotten your GCKey username or password, you'll need to recover them through the account you

            <ul>
                <li>first find the account or online service you plan to use </li>
                <li>select the GCKey button to sign in to the account you want to use</li>
                <li>On the Welcome to GCKey page, select <strong>Forgot your username</strong> or <strong>Forgot

            </ul>
            <p>If you selected <strong>Forgot your username</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter Your Recovery email address:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>you provided your recovery email either when you signed up for your GCKey username and password

                        later time</li>
                    <li>if you didn't add a recovery email address and have forgotten your username or password, you
                        have to
                        sign up for a new GCKey and register again with each of the
                        accounts you use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>THEN WHAT HAPPENS??</p>

                </li>
                    <p>THIS IS A MESS AND NEEDS MORE WORK. You can create a new password using a confirmation code and providing the correct answer to only
                        one of
                        your recovery questions or by providing the correct answers to all of your recovery questions.
