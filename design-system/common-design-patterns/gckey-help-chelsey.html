<p>Use your GCKey username and password to sign in to most Government of Canada online accounts and services. Anyone in any country can sign up and create a GCKey username and password to access online services.</p>

<h2> <a id="what"></a>What is a GCKey</h2>
<hr size="6" width="60%" color="blue">  
<p>A GCKey username and password can be used to sign in to any Government of Canada online account that supports GCKey. <strong>Once you have a GCKey, you still have to register for each online account,</strong>&nbsp;so it can match your GCKey username and password to your account profile.</p>
<p><strong>You usually only need one GCKey username and password</strong>&nbsp;to sign in to any government service that supports GCKey. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>sign up for a GCKey username and password to register and reserve a campsite in My Parks Canada Reservation Account</li>
<li>then use your same GCKey username and password to register and sign in to My Service Canada Account to manage your Employment Insurance or Canada Pension</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have more than one GCKey. For example, you may want one for work vs one for personal accounts. If you do sign up for more than one GCKey:</p>
<ul>
<li>remember which username and password you use for each type of service</li>
<li>use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username and password pair</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: GCKey usernames and passwords expire if they are not used for two years or more. If you GCKey expires you will need to sign up for a new one.</p>
<h2>Sign up process for GCKey</h2>
<h3>How to &nbsp;sign up for a GCKey:</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/sign-in-online-account.html">find the account or government service&nbsp;</a>you want to register for</li>
<li>then use the&nbsp;<strong>GCKey button&nbsp;</strong>to register if GCKey is supported for that account</li>
<li>on the Welcome to GCKey page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Sign up&nbsp;</strong>button</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you sign in to that account in the future, use the GCKey username and password to sign in.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone in any country&nbsp;</strong>can use the GCKey service provided by the Government of Canada.</p>
<h3>Creating your username and password</h3>
<h4>Create your username</h4>
<p>You can find rules for creating your username in the&nbsp;<strong>Username Checklist</strong>&nbsp;box on the&nbsp;<strong>Create your username</strong>&nbsp;page. You will not be able to proceed unless all requirements listed in that checklist are met.</p>
<p>As you enter a username a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; or a green checkmark will appear in the&nbsp;<strong>Username Checklist</strong>. The &ldquo;x&rdquo; means you have not met the username requirements. The checkmark means you have met the username requirements.</p>
<p>Each username must be unique. You will receive a message if the username you create has already been used.</p>
<h4>Create your password</h4>
<p>You can find rules for creating your password in the&nbsp;<strong>Password Checklist</strong>&nbsp;box. You will not be able to proceed unless all password requirements are met.</p>
<p>As you enter a password a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; or a green checkmark will appear in the&nbsp;<strong>Password Checklist</strong>. The &ldquo;x&rdquo; means you have not met the password requirements. The checkmark means you have met the password requirements.</p>
<h5>Tips for creating a username and password</h5>
<p>When creating your username and password, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>make them easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess</li>
<li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing address, or email address</li>
<li>keep your username and password secure and do not share it with anyone</li>
</ul>
<h5>Confirm your password</h5>
<p>You must re-enter your password exactly as you entered it into the&nbsp;<strong>Create Your Password</strong>&nbsp;field. If both passwords do not match, you will not be able to proceed.</p>
<p>When creating your password, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>make your password easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess</li>
<li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing address, or email address</li>
<li>keep your password secure and do not share it with anyone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding your email address and recovery questions</h3>
<h4>Create recovery questions, answers and hints</h4>
<p>Recovery questions are used to help you if you forget your password.</p>
<p>Your questions, answers and hints should be easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.</p>
<p>Recovery questions and answers are mandatory. To create yours follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>for the first question, choose a recovery question from the&nbsp;<strong>Select a Recovery Question</strong></li>
<li>enter an answer to the question in the&nbsp;<strong>My Recovery Answer</strong></li>
<li>next, enter the name of someone you will remember in the&nbsp;<strong>Memorable Person</strong>
<ul>
<li>if you think you may forget the answer to this question, you can enter a hint in the&nbsp;<strong>Memorable Person Hint</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>next, enter a date that you will remember in the&nbsp;<strong>My Memorable Date</strong>
<ul>
<li>if you think you may forget the answer to this question, you can enter a hint in the&nbsp;<strong>Memorable Date Hint</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Add your email address in case you forget username or password</h4>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>Optional Account Recovery</strong>&nbsp;page you can add an email address. This email address will be used to help you recover your GCKey account if you forget your username or password.</p>
<p>You do not have to add an email address, this step is optional.</p>
<p>As you enter an email address a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; or a green checkmark will appear in the&nbsp;<strong>Email Checklist</strong>. The &ldquo;x&rdquo; means you have not met the email requirements. The checkmark means you have met the email requirements.</p>
<h5>If your email address has already been used</h5>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If your email address is associated with another GCKey account, a warning message will appear indicating that your email address is already in use. You will have the option to:</p>
<ul>
<li>attempt to recover the username and/or password of the other GCKey account associated with that email address by following the process for username recovery or password reset</li>
<li>register a different email address</li>
<li>register the email address to your new GCKey account by completing the email address registration process. If you choose to complete this process, the system will then remove the email address from your other GCKey account</li>
</ul>
<h5>Confirmation code:</h5>
<p>The confirmation code is the code sent to the recovery email address associated with your GCKey account. It allows you to verify that the email address you entered is correct. Once you have confirmed your email address by entering the confirmation code, the email address can then be used to help you in case you forget your GCkey username or password.</p>
<h2>How to sign in using GCKey</h2>
<p>When accessing a Government of Canada online account, ensure you sign in the same way each time. If you have previously used a GCKey to sign in, ensure you sign in with the same GCKey username and password you used to register for that online account.</p>
<p>How to sign in with GCKey:</p>
