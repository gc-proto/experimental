<hr size="6" width="100%" color="blue">  
<p>A GCKey username and password can be used to sign in to <strong>any Government of Canada online account</strong> that supports GCKey.</p> 
<p><strong>It's not an account.</strong> Once you create a GCKey, you still have to register for each online account,</strong>&nbsp;so it can match your GCKey username and password to your account profile.</p>
<p>You usually only need one GCKey username and password to sign in to any government service that supports GCKey. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a GCKey username and password to register and reserve a campsite in My Parks Canada Reservation Account</li>
<li>then use your same GCKey username and password to register and sign in to My Service Canada Account to manage your Employment Insurance or Canada Pension</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GCKey usernames and passwords expire if they are not used for two years or more. If your GCKey expires you will need to sign up for a new one.</p>
<p>You can use the same GCKey with different computers. All internet browsers must have JavaScript and Cookies enabled for the GCKey to work.</p>

<h5>If your email address has already been used</h5>
<p>If your email address is associated with another GCKey account, a warning message will appear indicating that your email address is already in use. Only one unique email address can be linked to an account. You will have the option to:</p>
<ul>
<li>attempt to recover the username and/or password of the other GCKey account associated with that email address by following the process for username recovery or password reset</li>
<li>register a different email address</li>
<li>register the email address to your new GCKey account by completing the email address registration process. If you choose to complete this process, the system will then remove the email address from your other GCKey account</li>

<details>    
<summary><a id="createmore"></a>Creating more than one GCKey</summary>    
<p>You can have more than one GCKey. For example, you may want one for work vs one for personal accounts. If you do create more than one GCKey:</p>
<ul>
<li>remember which username and password you use for each type of service</li>
<li>use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username and password pair</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have more than one GCKey, ensure you keep track of which GCKey you have associated with each government account. Once a GCKey is linked to a specific government account, you need to use the same GCKey username and password to sign in each time.</p>
