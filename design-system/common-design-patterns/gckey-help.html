             <h3>
              <a id="registering"></a>Signing up for a new GCKey username and password
             </h3>
             <p>The GCKey service is provided by the Government of Canada so that you can sign with the same username and password for services from different departments and agencies. You can use the same GCKey username and password from different computers and from your mobile phone browser, as long as you keep the browsers updated.   </p>
             <p><strong>You don't usually need more than one GCKey username and password.</strong>If you already have created a GCKey username and password, you can use it when you register for another account or service. </p>
            <p>You can also sign up for a different GCKey username and password if you prefer, for example for work vs personal accounts. You'll need to remember which username and password pair goes with which service. You'll also need to use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username and password. </p>
             <h4>Create Your Username:</h4>
             <p>When creating your Username, we recommend that you:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>make your Username easy for you to remember and hard for others to guess;</li>
              <li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing address, or email address;</li>
              <li>always keep your Username secure and do not share it with anyone.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Rules for Username creation are located in the Username Checklist Box.</p>
             <p>As your Username selection is entered, the rules will either reflect a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; to indicate you have not met the requirement, or to a green checkmark to indicate the requirement has been met.</p>
             <p>You will not be able to proceed unless all rules are met.</p>
             <p>The following characters are permitted in your Username:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>Capital letters (A - Z)</li>
              <li>Lower-case letters (a - z)</li>
              <li>French characters (àâæçéèêëîïôœùûüÿÀÂÆÇÉÈÊËÎÏÔŒÙÛÜŸ)</li>
              <li>Digits (0 - 9)</li>
              <li>Special characters: $ % ^ : { } ~ ' ? / | &amp; * _ - . ` ( ) [ ] !</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Each Username must be unique. You will receive a message if it has already been used.</p>
             <h4>Create Your Password:</h4>
             <p>When creating your Password, we recommend that you:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>make your Password easy for you to remember and hard for others to guess;</li>
              <li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing address, or email address;</li>
              <li>keep your Password secure and do not share it with anyone.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Rules for your Password creation are located in the Password Checklist Box.</p>
             <p>As your Password selection is entered, the rules will either reflect a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; to indicate you have not met the requirement, or to a green checkmark to indicate the requirement has been met.</p>
             <p>You will not be able to proceed unless all rules are met.</p>
             <h4>Confirm Your Password:</h4>
             <p>
              You must re-enter your Password exactly as you entered it into the <em>Create Your Password</em> field. If both Passwords do not match, you will not be able to proceed.
             </p>
             <h4>Create Recovery Questions, Answers and Hints:</h4>
             <p>These are used to assist you when you forget your password.</p>
             <p>Your questions, answers and hints should be easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess. You can optionally use hints to assist you with remembering your answers to these questions.</p>
             <h4>Optional: Add Email Address for Username and Password Recovery</h4>
             <p>The email address is used to assist you when you forget your username or password. This is an optional step, and you can add your recovery email anytime by going to your main GCKey account page and navigating to the Manage Email section.</p>
             <h4>Confirmation Code:</h4>
             <p>This is the code sent to the recovery email address associated with your GCKey account. It is used to confirm your email for username and password recovery.</p>
             <p>Note: If your email address is associated with another GCKey account, a warning message will appear indicating that it is already in use. You have the option to 1) attempt to recover the username and/or password of the other GCKey account by following the process for username recovery or password reset, 2) register a different email address or 3) register the email address to your new GCKey account by completing the email address registration process; completing this process will remove the email address from the other GCKey account </p>

             <h4>Answers to Recovery Questions:</h4>
             <p>You created Recovery Questions, Answers and Hints when you signed up for your GCKey. In order to allow you to perform the Forgot Your Password function, you must now provide the correct answers to these questions.</p>
             <h4>Create Your New Password:</h4>
             <p>When creating your Password, we recommend that you:</p>
