            </h2>
            <p>GCKey is provided by the Government of Canada so that you can sign with the <strong>same username and
                password to different accounts </strong>across government departments and agencies.</p>
                <p>You still have to register
                for each account, so that it can match your GCKey username and password to your account profile.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For example, you can sign up for a GCKey username and password to register and reserve a campsite in My Parks
                    Canada Reservation Account</li>
                <li>then use your same GCKey username and password to register and sign in to My Service Canada Account
                    to manage your Employment Insurance or Canada Pension</li>
                <li><strong>anyone in any country </strong>can sign up and get a GCKey username and password </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>You usually only need one GCKey username and password.</strong>You can also sign up for another
                GCKey username and password, for example for work vs
                personal accounts. Make sure to remember which username and password pair to use with each service.
                You'll also need to use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username and password. </p>

                <h3>Create Your Username:</h3>
                <p>When creating your Username, we recommend that you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>make your Username easy for you to remember and hard for others to guess;</li>
                    <li>avoid using personal information, such as your name, Social Insurance Number (SIN), mailing

                <p>As your Username selection is entered, the rules will either reflect a red &ldquo;x&rdquo; to

                    you have not met the requirement, or to a green checkmark to indicate the requirement has been met.
                </p>

                </ul>
